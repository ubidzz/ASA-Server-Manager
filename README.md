# ASA Server Manager

### I had a 95% finished project and when i try to push it to github i lost everything but I was able to keep the build exe file that works in till i rebuild the hole thing over.
The EXE file is unplublished so you will get a warning downloading it and when you start it. The file is clean there no hacking, no virues and it don't even ask to run it in Admin.

The only things that I didn't get done was to finish 2 buttons that edit the ASA server config files but everything else works and will run a server.
The manager also has a builtin auto restart server if the server ever crashes.
Due to wildcard releasing a update that made it so you can't change the ports it's listing on the manager uses the default ports of 7777 and 27015

## The EXE file was built in c++/cli .Net framework v4.7.2

# The Files that are in the Github are not the same as the download ASA Server Manager link that I have posted and are the new files for a rebuilt version!
